    <h1>THIS IS MY TEXT</h1>
    <p>We will get straight to the point: This Wednesday we ask you to protect Wikipedia's independence. Time is running out in 2017 to help us. We depend on donations averaging about $15. Only a tiny portion of our readers give. If everyone reading this gave $3, we could keep Wikipedia thriving for years to come. The price of your Wednesday coffee is all we need. When I made Wikipedia a non-profit, people warned me I’d regret it. But if Wikipedia became commercial, it'd be a great loss to the world. Wikipedia is a place for you to learn, not a place for advertising. It unites all of us who love knowledge: contributors, readers and the donors who keep us thriving. The heart and soul of Wikipedia is a community of people working to bring you unlimited access to reliable, neutral information. Please help keep Wikipedia growing. Thank you. — Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia Founder</p>
